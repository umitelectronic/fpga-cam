The goal of this project is to interface the low cost ov7670 sensor to a cheap FPGA platform (papilio).
When interfacing will be done, the goal is to provide IP's to construct a RAM free pipeline for basic vision (object detection, line tracking ...).
This project will use free development tools, and will follow a strict development flow starting with a systemC implementation.
